    &lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    This App uses Google Analytics to help analyse how people use it.
    Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information
    in an anonymous form. Note that the data is anonymous - no personally identifiable information
    is collected.  The anonymous information generated by Google Analytics
    is transmitted to Google – not the Sky Map developers. Google Analytics then compiles
    statistical reports for us on the percentage of users that use certain features or
    have certain versions of Android. This is essential for us in discovering which features
    people like and dislike and when we can drop support for obsolete versions of Android
    and thus make Sky Map better.&lt;br/&gt;
    We respect your privacy and do not collect your personal information. If you do not
    wish to share this anonymous data with Google Analytics you can opt out via the settings menu.
    Otherwise, thank you for helping make Sky Map better. For more information on
    Google Analytics see  https://www.google.com/analytics/
